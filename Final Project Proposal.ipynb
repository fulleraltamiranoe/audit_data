    "Audit is defined as the process of evaluating a business’s financial statements to ensure that these records concur with the expectations of standard accounting laws. The ability to detect fraudulent activity in a firm (i.e. a business) which may warrant an audit is essential to modern-day, efficient audit management. In this investigation, we will attempt to answer a **predictive** question with **classification** based on various audit risk factors: Given a firm’s amount of money involved in misstatements in past audits (“Money Value [USD]”) and total amount of discrepancies found in other reports (“Total [USD]”), can we accurately predict a firm’s appropriate Risk Class: “fraud” or “no fraud?” \n",
    "\n",
    "The “Audit Data” dataset will be used to answer this question. This dataset contains various predictors about 777 Indian firms over a one-year period from 2015 to 2016, cataloging past and present historical audit risk factors. A classification model can be built upon these three selected factors to predict and identify potentially fraudulent firms."
